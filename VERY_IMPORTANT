If the following doctype is used:
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">
then there may be a problem with JavaScript that runs when the page is loaded,
if js is used to do the initial layout it may cause troubles!
The following doctype can be used:
//<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN">


///########## VALIDATE A PAGE USING PHP
1. The code should be taken when the page is loaded and all code is entered like HTML
than copy that text and validate it by direct input to the w3c validator
2. The content you add dynamicly should not contain <html><head><body></body></head></html>
otherwise you get several "<html><head><body></body></head></html>" which is
defenetly wrong and will never parse against w3c validator
