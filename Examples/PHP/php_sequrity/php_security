1. sql injection - use prepared statements
2. filtrera indata så att användaren inte skickar in html kod - htmlspecialchars($_GET['btitle'])
3. use password hashing- that means passwords are stored in db not as original
  but as a string of different characters created with a crypt algor like md5 or sha1

  so :
   - when user types in a password the password becomes crypted and compares with
        the crypted password stored in the db
   - also when using crypting the so called "Salt" is preffered to be used
        it makes it more difficult to hack it all: Example of using salt --->

        //the salt "appendix" adds a string to the start of the crypted password
        // in this case i ad the 2 last chars of users username + word kocmoc
        $salt = '$1$' . substr($username, -2) . 'kocmoc$';
        $md5_password = crypt($password, $salt);
        //checks against the db
        $login_ok = userExistsInDBPreparedStatement($username, $md5_password, "users");
